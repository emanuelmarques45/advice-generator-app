## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I got a little more familiarized with fetch method to get information.

```js
const getRandomQuote = async () => {
    const req = await fetch('https://api.quotable.io/random?maxLength=100')
    const res = await req.json()
    return res
}

btnGetQuote.addEventListener('click', () => {
  getRandomQuote().then(data => {
    paragraphQuote.innerText = `${data.content}`
    paragraphAuthor.innerText = `- ${data.author}`
    adviceNumber.innerText = ++adviceCounter
  )}
```

### Continued development

I am going to search more about fetch and API to implement on my future projects.
